Software to compute interstation correlations, including fast implementations of the 
phase cross-correlation (Ventosa et al., SRL 2019) and wavelet phase cross-correlation
(Ventosa & Schimmel, 2023) with and without using the GPU.

Main features
-------------
Computes 4 types of correlations:
 * The Standard (geometrically) normalized cross-correlations (GNCC).
 * The 1-bit amplitude normalization followed by the GNCC (1-bit GNCC).
 * The phase cross-correlation (PCC).
 * The wavelet phase cross-correlation (WPCC).

The computations of PCC and WPCC are speed-up in several ways:
 * Both are parallelized in the CPU using OpenMP and in the GPU using CUDA (two independent codes).
 * The computational cost of PCC with power of 2 is reduced to about twice the one of 1-bit GNCC.

Compilation
-----------
To compile execute "make" in the src directory. Use "make clean" to remove 
any previouly compiled code.

 * The Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) is used to read and write sac files.
 * The FFTW double and single precision libraries are use 
 * The SACHOME enviorment variable should provide the path to directory where sac is
   installed. For example, in bash this can be defined as:  
   export SACHOME=/opt/sac  
   Change "/opt/sac" to your current sac directory if necessary.
 * OpenMP is used to speed up computations. When OpenMP is not available, use 
   make -f makefile_NoOpenMP".
